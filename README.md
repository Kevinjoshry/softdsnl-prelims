Car Performance Prediction
It predicts the car's performance based on speed, horsepower and year of release.

This dataset contains information about various Toyota car models. Each record represents a specific car model and includes numerical attributes related to its performance and production year. The dataset is used to train a machine learning model that can predict the model of a car based on its specifications.

horsepower The engine power of the car, typically measured in horsepower (HP). Indicates the strength of the engine.

speed: The top speed the car can achieve, measured in kilometers per hour (km/h).

year: The year the car model was released. Helps identify the era or generation of the model.

Target Label:

model (string): The name of the Toyota car model (e.g., Camry, Corolla, Supra). This is the value the machine learning model is trained to predict.

Reflection:

Why did you choose this dataset?
I chose this dataset because I have a strong interest in cars and their various specifications.
Working with car data allowed me to engage with a topic Iâ€™m passionate about while learning how 
to apply machine learning techniques. This dataset, which includes features like horsepower, 
speed, and year of release, provided a practical and relatable example to explore prediction 
models and data visualization.

What did you learn?
Through this project, I learned how to preprocess data, train a machine learning model, and 
evaluate its predictions. I also gained experience with data visualization tools like seaborn 
and matplotlib, which helped me better understand the relationships between different car 
features. Additionally, I improved my debugging skills, especially when handling errors related 
to data formats and plotting functions.

What were the challenges you encountered?
One of the main challenges was ensuring that the dataset was properly formatted and that all 
required features were included when training and predicting. Debugging errors related to 
visualization, such as using unsupported arguments in plotting functions, was also a hurdle. 
Moreover, working with categorical data like car models required transforming text labels into 
numeric codes, which took some trial and error to get right.

How would you improve your project?
To improve the project, I would expand the dataset by incorporating more car models and 
additional features such as fuel efficiency, weight, or engine type. A larger and more diverse 
dataset would likely lead to better model accuracy and more insightful visualizations. 
Furthermore, I would explore more advanced machine learning algorithms and possibly add an 
interactive user interface for easier prediction input and result interpretation.
